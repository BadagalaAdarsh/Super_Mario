# Super_Mario
* Hello all this is a simple python program which tries to use our body as a controller for the super mario game
* Here I have used media pipe to detect the body posture
* then based on the based posture I have stimulated the keyboard input using pynput module of the python
* as single press of the key is not sufficient to make the mario move I have used multithreading concept to simulataneously run different methods
* In order to run this program in your machine just install the dependencies like opencv, mediapipe, pynput and run the main.py file
* after that stand in front of the camera in center position
* Thats it you are good to go now
