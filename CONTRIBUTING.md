Hello Guys

Around one year back I have created this project just for fun, so it was prepared in such a way that it only works for my case because I have given left and right threshold values manualy

But now I would like to develop it in such  a way that user can set the left, right and top threshold through the UI itself without making any code changes

So here I am asking the opensource community to help me with this
